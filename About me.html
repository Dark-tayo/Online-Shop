    <p>
    My name is Sanusi Eyitayo Samuel, and I am someone who is passionate about learning and personal growth. I enjoy challenges that push me to think outside the box and improve my skills.</p>
    <p>I'm a University of Ibadan student in the department of computer science. I am a frontend developer even though I am still a learner. I am 18 years old.</p> 
   <p> In my free time, I like watching animes, which help me stay inspired and balanced. I believe in continuous learning and am excited about the opportunities ahead to grow both personally and professionally.
   <p>I am a football enthusiast. That is why today I'm creating a football jersey online store</p>
